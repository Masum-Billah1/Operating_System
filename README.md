<h4>Response time = Time of first response</h4>
<h4>Turnaround Time = Completion time - Arrival time</h4>
<h4>Waiting time = Turn around time - Burst time</h4>

<h3>Round Robin</h3>
step 1 : Generating a string that contains only process number.<br>
step 2 : Drawing a ganntt chart by calling a created functions.
step 3 : implementing response time, turn around time, waiting time through individual functions.
