<h1>scheduling algorithm</h1>
<h4>Response time = Time of first response</h4>
<h4>Turnaround Time = Completion time - Arrival time</h4>
<h4>Waiting time = Turn around time - Burst time</h4>

<h3>Steps for all algorithm</h3>
step 1 : Generating a string that contains only process number.<br>
step 2 : Drawing a ganntt chart by calling a created functions.<br>
step 3 : implementing response time, turn around time, waiting time through individual functions.

<h1>scheduling algorithm</h1>
<h4>Bankers algorithm/safe sequence</h4>
step 1 : need[i][j] = maximum[i][j] - allocation[i][j]<br>
step 2 : avaiable = available+allocation (after completing a process)
